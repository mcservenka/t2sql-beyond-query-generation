# Beyond Query Generation

State-of-the-Art Text-to-SQL benchmarks represent one-dimensional challenges for modern LLMs, assuming answerability for every question in a dataset. However, in practical applications unanswerable user inputs have to be handles accordingly as well. This repository provides the source code for the paper **Beyond Query Generation: Assessing Unanswerable Questions in Text-to-SQL**, which addresses this gap by augmenting the Spider and BIRD-SQL datasets and evaluating four modern LLMs on their ability to identify unanswerable questions.
